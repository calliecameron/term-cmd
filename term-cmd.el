;; Send commands to Emacs from programs running in term.el.
;;
;; In vanilla Emacs, programs running in term.el can send commands
;; back to Emacs by printing a 'magic escape sequence' which the
;; terminal emulator parses -- this is how directory tracking
;; works.  But the list of commands is hard-coded, and you can't add
;; new ones.
;;
;; This package lets you add new commands.  It uses a different magic
;; escape sequence to avoid interfering with the built-in commands,
;; but the principle is the same.  When a program prints a command, it
;; won't show up on the screen, but will instead be interpreted by
;; Emacs.
;;
;; This is a library, and doesn't make any user-visible changes.  For
;; an example of something that uses it, see the 'term-alert' package
;; (https://github.com/calliecameron/term-alert).
;;
;;
;; Usage
;;
;; To register a command:
;;
;;     (add-to-list
;;      'term-cmd-commands-alist
;;      '("command" . some-callback-function))
;;
;; where "command" is the name of the command, and
;; some-callback-function is the function you want to be called when
;; the command is run.  The function should take two arguments -- the
;; first is the command name itself, and the second is the command's
;; argument.
;;
;; To send a command, use the emacs-term-cmd script:
;;
;;     emacs-term-cmd command arg
;;
;; If called outside Emacs, this does nothing (i.e. it won't mess
;; things up).
;;
;; Because the commands are based on terminal output, they work just
;; as well through nested shells, multiple SSH sessions, or tmux (not
;; 100% reliable -- see comments in emacs-term-cmd).
;;
;;
;; Installation
;;
;; Install the term-cmd package from MELPA.
;;
;; The emacs-term-cmd command will always be on the PATH of any shell
;; launched from Emacs.  However, for full functionality you should add
;; ~/.emacs.d/term-cmd (or wherever your user-emacs-directory is) to
;; the PATH in your environment or shell's startup files, too
;; (e.g. ~/.profile, ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, etc.), on any machine you
;; often SSH into; this will allow shells inside tmux or on other
;; machines to send commands back to Emacs on your local machine.

;;; Code:

(require 'term)
(require 'dash)
(require 'f)

;;;###autoload
(defvar term-cmd-commands-alist '()
  "Commands to run based on process output.
Elements should be of the form (<string> . <func>) where string is the
command to match on, and func takes two args, the command and the
command's argument.  To run a command from the terminal, output a line
of the form '\\eTeRmCmD <command> <arg>\\n', where arg is an arbitrary
string; the function with key <command> will be called with command
and arg.  Arg can also be omitted if it is not required.")

;; These functions handle partial messages at the end of the input,
;; but for Emacs' built-in directory-tracking commands rather than our
;; ones (the built-in commands use a different magic escape sequence,
;; only allow single-char commands, and are hardcoded in term.el -- so
;; not accessible to the user).  This is essentially a fix for a
;; term.el bug (see
;; http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=17231), but that patch
;; never got in, so I might as well do it here, right?
